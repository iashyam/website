# Lissajous Figures

Making Lissajous's Figures is a teadous process when we start from tracing the sine curves and making the superposition. It was very difficuilt for me too. Then I realised I had programming power. So I made this program.

## What are Lissajous's Figures?

When two perpendicular simpoer harmonic motions superimpose, they make some beautiful images and it is called Lissajous's Figures.

Genral equation for Lissajous's Figures is given by

{{< katex >}}

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{2xy}{ab}\cos\delta=\sin^2\delta$$

## How to draw them?

In this program I have plotted the first SHM on x axis and the other SHM on y axis.

$$
x=a\sin(t\omega_1)
$$

$$
y=b\sin(t\omega_2+\delta)
$$

I have gievn sliders to control

1. the phase differace delta
2. The ratio of frequencies w1/w2
3. The Ratio of amplitudes
